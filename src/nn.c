 * This is a basic implementation of a feed forward neural network in C. The 
 * library handles only fully connected feed forward networks. It is not 
 * intended for back-propgoation training. The library allows for the 
 * dimensions of the neural network as will as the actication function
 * for each layer to be specified.
